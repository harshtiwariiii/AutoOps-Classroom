# Branching Strategy

- **main**: Stable code, production-ready.
- **frontend**: Frontend development.
- **backend**: Backend development.
- **data**: Data engineering, database scripts.
- **models**: ML models for skill extraction.

Each feature or fix should be developed in its respective branch and merged into `main` after review and testing.
